### MIGROS HACKZURICH 2023 Sustanability AI Shopping Challenge

### Our recommender system

We integrate recommendations of both users (collaborative filtering) and products (content-based filtering) to provide a more personalized shopping experience.
In detail:

- Users with similar shopping behavior are clustered together and recommendations are made based on the items they have in common, all depending on the history of purchases.
- Products are clustered based on their similarity (in an embedding space) depending on the type of product and the brand.

###Â File structure

- cloud_function: api deployed on google cloid that serves the recommendation systems to the frontend
- notebooks: various notebooks peforming processing of data and testing
- Migros_case: Data of Migros
- functions.py: all implementation functions of recommandation systems (user centric + similarity across products)
